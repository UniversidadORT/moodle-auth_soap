SOAP Authentication plugin for Moodle
=====================================

Installation
------------

* Unpack zip or clone repo so as to qet:
pathToMoodle/auth/soap
* Copy [nusoap](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/) library in:
pathToMoodle/auth/soap/lib/nusoap

Notes
-----
I use [nusoap](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/) as I found problems in all other libraries I tried. This may change in the future.
